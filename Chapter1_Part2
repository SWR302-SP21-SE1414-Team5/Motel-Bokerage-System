2. Product Background
When new students come to FPT, if they don’t want to stay in dorms, they will choose staying in motel (outside of University area). It’s usually takes students (or student parents)
from 4-8 weeks to find a motel that comfortable and convenient to stay, this happen not only for new students but also for student who already studying in FU.  This wasting of time
to finding place arise because lack of information and confirmation. Posts in groups on Facebook is not always provide enough information and status of rooms in motel, if students
want to know details, they have to notice other student’s comments in that post to see that is motel as good as its describe. Hence to these problems, we come up with an idea 
creating a website/application that give students an easier way to find motel, also give them the ability to give feedback about motel. Besides, its also help motel owners a way 
to advertise there motel to students.
